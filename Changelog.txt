=== Version/Release 1.1.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2017.11.05; Minor code change and bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Refactored some code
  and fixed a bug whereby unexpected responses could report as everything being
  already up-to-date instead of displaying an error message. Also improved
  status message aesthetic.

- [2017.12.06; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added the new method "localUpdate" and
  the ability to perform updates locally. This new ability requires package
  versions CIDRAM >= 1.3.0 or phpMussel >= 1.2.0 (older versions won't be able
  to be updated using this method). Package loaders must also be updated.
