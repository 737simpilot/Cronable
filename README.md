Currently, this repository serves as a personal reminder for an idea I had for a new PHP project, which may or may not eventuate into anything. At this time, it remains in the idea phase, and although it would be nice of it eventuates into something, I haven't yet penned it out or tested its viability, and there's no guarantee that this repository will continue to exist in the future. This message may be replaced at some point in the future with an introduction to a cool new project, or the repository itself may just be deleted entirely; I'm not sure yet. :D
